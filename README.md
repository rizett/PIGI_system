# PIGI_system
This repository contains Matlab, LabVIEW and AutoIt software scripts to acquire and process data from the PIGI system (Izett & Tortell, 2020; Oceanography). Technical and CAD drawings are also provided.

The LabVIEW files contain scripts to acquire, display and record underway deployment data. LabVIEW files were written using version 2019, SP1. The base, full and professional development programs (require license) can be downloaded here: https://www.ni.com/en-ca/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview.html#329059, and the 2019 runtime engine can be downloaded from https://www.ni.com/en-ca/support/downloads/software-products/download.labview.html#346878. 

The AutoIt files contain scripts to automatically re-start underway data acquisitions. AutoIt can be downoloaded freely here: https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-tools/

The Matlab files contain scripts to read and process deployment data. An example dataset is provided. These scripts are not compatible with Octave.

The technical diagrams contain specifications for machining components of the PIGI system. Diagrams were produced using Solidworks, and can be viewed without a license. Additional Solidworks files, containing 3D CAD assembly diagrams are also included.
