This folder contains an AutoIt (https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit-tools/) script to automatically re-start PIGI LabVIEW acquisitions. 

The script can be edited by opening the .au3 file. After making edits, the file MUST be re-compiled into an executable (.exe) file (Right click --> compile --> rename the compiled file as run_acquisition_compiled.exe).

The .exe file must be referenced in the PIGI_automation_restart LabVIEW program.
